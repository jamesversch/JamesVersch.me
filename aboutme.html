            <p class="tiletext">After playing an Internation Master my freshman year of college, I became
                more interested in the game. During quarantine I have had the opportunity to
                play more and have risen by more than 300 rating points.

            <p class="tiletext">I am fortunate enough to have been to many cool places. Some of my favorites
                include Iceland where I stood on a glacier and the Amazon Rain Forest, where I helped with
                preservation efforts.

            <p class="tiletext">I started skiing when I was really young and have always enjoyed it. Going to school
                at Dartmouth has allowed me to ski more often. I even joined the Club Ski Racing team 
                where I compete in races.
